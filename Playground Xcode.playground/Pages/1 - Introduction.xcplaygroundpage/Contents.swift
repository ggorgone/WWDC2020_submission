 Privacy is something we start appreciating since we were kids. Do you remember your first crush ‚ù§Ô∏è ? Yeah, exactly! And I remember too. And I also remember that we wrote each others some love notes, but I wanted only she could read them. When we were close we exchanged directly the notes, but sometimes when we were not sitted at the same desk in the classroom, other kids read our notes and made fun of us üò≥ . . .  Anyway, privacy is an important topic. Let's dive into it !
