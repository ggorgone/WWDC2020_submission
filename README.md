# WWDC2020 Submission: a playground on security

## Description

The topics of the playground are privacy and security when exchanging messages. I did it to explain in an easy and maybe a bit playful manner some of the differences between **symmetric** and **asymmetric cryptography** applied to that context.

In particular there is a graphical simulation of a **"man in the middle" attack**, in which I tried to explain what are some possible pre-requisites for being exposed to an attack of that type, and some possible consequences for the victims. After that simulation there is an explanation for a possible fix. I used only everyday objects like padlocks and keys in the entire playground because I think it’s a good way to begin to understand what are the issues and the remedies when talking about cryptography and about security.

I’ve used **SwiftUI** for the GUI and AVFoundation for the audio effects. I coded the entities used in the playground following some of the **objects oriented programming principles**, and exploited the overloading and the type-checking features of the swift language to create items and behaviors as close to reality as possibile.
